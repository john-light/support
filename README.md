#### <a name="btc_address"/>Question: How does the automatically generated Bitcoin address work? 

If you do not provide a Bitcoin address during registration, Onename will generate one for you. The private key of this Bitcoin address is saved on our servers encrypted with your password (we do *not* have access to the private key). The private key is also stored in the backup file that you saved on Dropbox/Gdrive.
